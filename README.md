This backend generates JSON aobjects based on predefined JSON scenarios.

What does it mean?

Enterprise Applications have highly complex, tightly integration, well defined, business dependent RELATIONAL data structures.

Data Access Scenarios defer based on user authorization, interface requirements.

JSON objects are commonly used at frontend processing and GET/PUT scenarios.

JPS can generate JSON objects but they do NOT know where to start or stop

NCB is a simple but sophisticated REST backend.

See presentation in doc for more details.
